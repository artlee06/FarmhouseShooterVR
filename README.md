Assignment 2
How to play:

Welcome to the farmhouse! Old Macdonald had a farm and there are a lot of chickens that want your attention. Feed them by grabbing the balls and they will leave you alone!

Pick up the multi colored balls around by holding the trigger on the right hand, aim properly at the chicken and release the trigger to feed the chickens!

Teleport by pointing the controller towards the floor, holding the down the trigger and release to teleport to the area you pointed at. Feel free to grab objects with your left hand by holding the trigger.

You can also pick up the vive boxes and throw at the wooden boxes and see what happens. Have fun!
